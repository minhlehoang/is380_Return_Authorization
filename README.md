# is380_Return_Authorization
Database Management
<h1>Project Description</h1>
<center>
	Things ‘n Things is an online company that sells hundreds of various products on its e-Commerce store, each product has a product number, description, and unit price.
	When customers are unsatisfied with their products, they return the products to Things ‘n Things, and Things ‘n Things issues credit to the customer. Each customer has a customer number and profile (such as name, address, etc.). 
	To return, the customer contacts our users at the Operations department and provides the product number, reason of the return, and how many units they are returning. 
	A return authorization is now ‘O’pened for this return with a return authorization (RA) number. Customer then mails the products to our warehouse. Our warehouse notifies our Operations department when it receives the products.
	Our Operations department then issues credits to the customer, and the return authorization is now ‘C’losed. 
	In addition to the processing of returns and credits, our management also wants to know why customers return (by reason code), how many returns have not been closed, and so on an so forth.
	Thing ‘n things have asked you to design a relational database (Entity Relationship Diagram and normalized tables) for the return process, and to complete the following five programs to process returns and produce reports for the management.
